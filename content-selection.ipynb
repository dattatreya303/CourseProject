Yeah, and she knows that Kevin was always there for her and that's I think  Think she realized like this is a good thing that I let go of my life because I was selfish. She's like there is no going backwards and changing this if you do that, so you might want to plead not guilty and go to court and let us, you know, get this expunged all together and I have to say that was a kind of pins and needles  want to see what he was going to do because for a minute I thought he was still gonna, you know, plead guilty there after seeing what they did with Paul and they just so quickly wrote him out of the show had him, you know, he's guilty and he's gone part of me always worries now that you could take somebody like John landstrom and Kevin and have him plead guilty and then that take them off and he could have Ryan still pop up to wrap up that part of the storyline, but you could easily just get Kevin off the canvas. Yeah says, you know, we're not going to do this just based on one set of parents is concerns, but I felt like he'd let Willow just get chewed out a bit by the two of them before he really stepped in and said because they have money that's why whenever think about it whenever there whenever parents come to a school and they have money and they want to complain about  Teacher or how things are being run at the school.\",\n",

I'd always ask for gaming-related presents from my family and eagerly look for the game-shaped present in the pile of gifts under the tree. But, after battling against a gaming addiction for the last 5 years, I've come to place a lot more value on how important family is over Christmas.\\xa0 I think about all the holidays I spent playing games and not engaging in activities. How must that have made my parents feel? As it's almost Christmas, and no doubt a lot of you will be struggling with managing your gaming over the holiday, I thought I'd do an episode for those of you who want to see what life can be like without gaming.\\xa0 Maybe you're a gamer that has wasted enough time in the virtual world, or you might be a non-gamer struggling with urges.

You can't do with a combination of your PC Plus your old phone social media YouTube If you want to get away from gaming or these things you've really want to be spending your time doing probably not. But when it comes to actually talking about it, I'd recommend bringing it up in a casual setting you could say something like oh, by the way, I think I'm going to try not playing any video games over Christmas. You have to get comfortable with being terrible at whatever hobby you decide to try out and realize that it's just perfectly normal over time your skills to develop into something incredible, but at the beginning it's going to be tough like really tough is what we tell people to take 90 days of gaming to give them the chance to get over the dopamine dependent brain that they've built up from Years of Gaming and to actually make  a real progress in new skills  But if you're only doing it over Christmas, it's going to be more difficult to advance as much as maybe you should have if you have things you want to take up such as learning a language and instrument woodworking hiking cooking working out Etc. Then now's the perfect time to do it.\",\n",

It's because of this I don't believe it this stuff or  I've evolved my understanding and trying to find something that really fits where I'm at in my life right now and I talked and I talked to my explained and explained and I was expecting this big Angry backlash from him this shouting and screaming but he actually didn't you didn't shout and scream he listened and then he proceeded to tell me why he felt religion was so important and the reason why it was so important to him because he said that when he was in Sri Lanka and he was a  young boy that was really a lot of difficult times for him growing up, you know, there was poverty and there was a lack of education and there was a civil war going on and a lot of it sort of hard hard trials and tribulations and he felt that it was religion or faith in God and the Catholic faith is what he had at the time was what got him through those difficult times and he wanted to just make sure that when he left this world  That he had left us. So they do it saying the words but they don't really believe it and I don't think they've allowed themselves to evolve their understanding or their beliefs in spirituality and in other areas of their life, but mainly spirituality  mainly in an understanding of what happens or how this was created and they haven't really allowed themselves to go to these questions because it's easier to just get on with the work and by the house and buy the car and support the family and kind of deal with the day-to-day things and I think they do get to later on in life and they have these midlife crisis because they're trying to understand who am I what am I what is all of this and they're big fundamental questions and I think sometimes a good understanding of  of Faith or having good discussions about some of these bigger questions can really help us alleviate things like depression and anxiety and lack on loss of purpose.\",\n",

That's kind of what I was saying earlier about the style in that in that Unforgiven is  does the kind of same thing where if you compare it to the Spaghetti Westerns that Clint did or many of the western the very kind of violent western films that he did in his career Unforgiven seems almost like not an apology but because looking back and trying to do something where he takes away all the myths and get something a bit more Bleak don't think yeah, it brings the reality of the  student into Focus because the the western films kind of just create the pleasures of the violence that that you see and The Unforgiven just brings you like it's an older man that has to live with the things that he did and has to return to the man that he used to be and that he still knows he is that hard and it's a tough watch and I think that's the same with with Irishman because he kind of gave us the progression of  has he started when Mean Streets where he gave us like the small the smallest time Gangster that you could have and it they kind of grows up the ranks in Goodfellas Henry's at that higher level and then you have a casino where they're they're building Los Angeles. I think this is  The video Essay with I was toying around with before we decide on this one, but I was just thinking about how you have the progression from Mean Streets to Goodfellas the casino to this one and how each one is a step up in terms of the scope and how close they are to power but really is the same impulses and a lot of way that yeah that the character is going to feed on likes course says he knows the environment because he grew up surrounded by those. But there is that it yeah, like the thing we're kind of trying to kind of get at at the end of our video is just too  the church and family thing and how it's like massively hypocritical the looks that Peggy gives throughout the film as a child and as an adult powerful and almost as spiritual core of the film and I reminded of one that I think is particularly effective when I think Frank is christening a new child and Peggy looks at all the Wiseguys the  At the ceremony and there's just something yeah, just not right about it.

We just have to have faith in ourselves but also in the humanity in US  that is a part of everyone as well and I do believe that it is a week like this that is going to give us that very opportunity to Glimpse that very Humanity to see extraordinary compassion that affirms our equality and that affirms our connection to each other that affirms a sense of truly being a part of a world community of being deeply interconnected to each other so it will be right around  Monday when Venus changes signs and moves into the sign of Pisces now Venus really likes being in the sign of Pisces. And so Venus in such a very spiritual sign is able to come most alive when she is here in the sign of Pisces and as we move right into the middle of the week right on Wednesday, give or take a day on either side depending on where you are on the planet that is  when Venus will reach out in harmony with Uranus and this to me is that energy of new ideas bringing Beauty bringing Harmony bringing peace bringing a real sense of compassion for ourselves and for each other it is that sense of us feeling as if we are stepping into a future of Greater Love happening at  Time now it may be a very personal experience happening here. I think that's part of what we're seeing with Saturn conjunct Pluto in the sign of Capricorn that that is something that is a dynamic that plays out in the world, but I think that it takes true creativity it takes Humanity really to find  Ways to create prosperity for oneself or for others or with others through peace and through Harmony, but it's possible it can be done and we've had lots and lots of examples and experiences in our own lives personally on perhaps a smaller scale but also on a more Collective scale as well. Yes personally, certainly  For the collective as well and I do think that if you set the intention to choose to see how it is that ultimately we are as part of the greater mystery moving towards the embodiment of Greater Love and greater wisdom for more and more people and more and more ways than ever before.\",\n",

You've again got to go down to not caring what other people think and I think  The basis of being confident in yourself is literally not caring what people think and it took me a long time with the YouTube stuff as well not to care because obviously when you when you have your whole life online and there's so many people judging you and you know, you're under a like a telescope and people are trying to you know dig at you and judge you by how you look or how you say things blah blah blah. It's something you have to work on quite intensely and the anxious feeling also ties in with the the confidence thing is caring what other people think it's like if you're going onto a track like with social anxiety people are scared to be in Social. That other people's opinions matter and I remember like stumbling over a couple words and thinking oh God.

You have a great lineage of Brewers that you know work for you all and then go on to go do their own thing maybe to become you know, their own head Brewer at a place that they start but there's always like this thankfulness aspect to that that I've noticed and that's that's that's great that you all kind of grow craft beer in that regard. Jeff Nichols likes to say we have 40 Years of recipes to draw from so whenever we start kicking around maybe we should Brew this or that he goes with there's probably something and logbook somewhere and then even beyond that if you think of the cores archives where we have the recipe for Madoff for Batch 19, which is a tops handwritten Brewing log script that they pull the recipe out of we've got plenty of  appease but at the same time so we can either draw back on some of those or it's saying, okay, we're seeing this little Trend happen or you know, this really would be interesting for us to brew and the guys will Brew up a batch and we'll give it a shot and I'll put it the employee bar and we'll see what the reception is. But yeah that the industry is Shifting I think beer is the growth is not there like it used to be so I think you're seeing Brewery start to diversify quite a bit. So we've been pretty busy and focus really on this brand refresh here and in July and August and we need to start thinking about 2020 but we've also got some hurdles to worry about we're having a good year so far.\",\n",

If you're using resources that are directly at your level, it's just the right level of difficulty when you're using these resources most things that you see tend to be new material the certain things you've seen and you're building on Concepts. It's it's it's all of the new material kind of Blends in but when most material you're using is stuff you've seen stuff you're reasonably confident with but then there's only  One or two things that are new those one or two things that are new actually stand out and you're like, oh this one or two things that are new and it's a lot easier to absorb those new Concepts because everything else you did with that particular resource will stop you seen it was not hard. I remembered them a lot faster than if I'd been reading something where every second word was like something I've never seen before so I think there's an argument. This is why going back to the first hi-low strategy I discussed why I think it's important to be using  Sources that are slightly too easy because in those resources that are slight and materials that are slightly too easy for you the still going to be some things that are new the still going to be some things you haven't seen and you're going to learn those things.\",\n",

Muthu did report some bullet wounds, but the official autopsies by the US government claimed that only two people Jim Jones and anymore his personal nurse had actually died of gunshot wounds the report claims that they both committed suicide with separate guns which leads to perhaps the largest inconsistency that fuels most conspiracy theories regarding  Like Jonestown Jones Body itself people wonder why was the gun that killed him found out of Arms Reach or why none of Jones chest tattoos were present at the time of autopsy or why did investigators have to run Jones fingerprints twice to properly identify him. The first Theory attempts to make sense of the massacre by placing the blame with CIA operatives conspiracy theorists suspect that the operatives killed Jones Ryan and the members of the peoples Temple for political reasons relating to the Cold War and the agencies growing sphere of influence the  Conspiracy theory is a little more out there claiming that Jones was actually a CIA operative and that Jonestown was the continuation of the cia's highly controversial MKUltra mind control program with a massacre being the agency's final test to see if it's decades-long experiment had worked. So  The theory argues the CIA using a combination of Green Berets and British Special Forces raided Jonestown to kill Jones and his followers and then framed it to look like a mass suicide that would certainly explain the forced puncture marks and the initial reports that some of the victims had been shot as well as poisoned as well as the fact that it looked like bodies had been staged but Jones probably would have fought back if the CIA had gone in guns.\",\n",

Add that the game they found in their family's basement with dice showing the numbers 12 and 7 facing up was connected to a conspiracy theory involving coded messages World War II and issue of the New Yorker magazine and the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. Weird when they found some information about the game connecting it to a conspiracy theory involving the attack on Pearl Harbor, like maybe the game was part of a secret code or signal involving the attack but there really wasn't a lot more than that are either of you guys open to conspiracies. And yeah, and I know where we really ever on the moon who's to say there's ya know my kids crazy that crazy kid had left the family nest and moved to the Twin Cities to start his adult life, but he never forgot about the game and so he asked his mom to take some photos of it so he could post them on the what is this thing subreddit and Justin finally got some ideas. So now you kind of have me I'm  Now because to me that is the most compelling weirdness, yeah that someone remembers a conversation from the 40s with someone who is looking into the game and there ain't no game and that's like the first sign usually of a company that's BS like something funky is going on your like you walk in you're like, oh, yes, sir.\",\n",

You found the male Lancaster and I think what I would say is don't be daunted by moving geographically the support I thought new starters these days and in the past has absolutely amazing and people to people you work with have really helped me enjoy it all my jobs very much. I think that's what matters having these, you know, great sweeping career plans isn't necessarily the thing that works in the kind of Market these days, you know for me, it's always about her. And  I think there's a danger of equating Career Success With both salary and perhaps sort of climbing the managerial ladders and I learned a very valuable lesson when I used to work at a different University and I work with a colleague who was incredibly bright incredibly capable and could have gone on to manage people and been a leader and and one day I was have a why why haven't you done that and she said well, I just love what I actually do. I like  selecting the data that I collect that's what I really enjoy and so I kind of absorbed that partly but it's only since took 10 years on from working with that lady and having sort of gone through management roles myself, which I really love but I also thoroughly understand why they're not for everybody and my top tip would be don't feel pressurized to earn a high salary and don't put moisturizer to be a manager if it's not for you because success is actually going into  a job that you love everyday and not noticing that you've just put 10 hours in and you're not in a rush to get home and and success is also about having a work-life balance that you know that enables you to do other things without feeling pressurized to to do work stuff when you you know, you already put those 10 hours in so I would say there's so many different jobs out there these days just follow your heart give advice and and success for you is being happy.\",\n",
